# Google Search Analysis

This project is designed to perform basic analysis on Google Search-related data. It includes multiple Python scripts that can be used to examine various aspects of user search behavior, such as search volume, click-through rates, and keyword trends.

## Contents

- `script_1.py` to `script_5.py`: Python scripts for different aspects of data analysis.
  - Each script reads the `search_data.csv` file and performs basic analysis such as previewing data, calculating averages, and identifying high-performing keywords.
- `search_data.csv`: A sample dataset containing the following columns:
  - `query`: Search terms entered by users.
  - `search_volume`: Estimated number of searches for each term.
  - `clicks`: Number of clicks generated from the search.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or later recommended).
2. Install the required library:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas
   ```
3. Run any of the Python scripts to see the analysis results:
   ```bash
   python script_1.py
   ```

Each script performs a different type of analysis. You can modify them to suit your own needs.
