# Google Search Analysis (Expanded)

## Introduction
This project is designed to provide insights into Google Search user behavior through data analysis. The analysis covers various aspects, including search volume, click-through rates (CTR), keyword performance, and more. It is an educational tool for understanding how search data can be processed and analyzed.

## Project Structure
- `search_data.csv`: The main dataset containing user search data.
- `script_1.py` to `script_5.py`: Python scripts for different data analysis tasks.
- `README.md`: The documentation file for the project.

## Dataset Details (Expanded)
The `search_data.csv` file now includes the following columns:
- `query`: Search terms entered by users.
- `search_volume`: Estimated number of searches for each term.
- `clicks`: Number of clicks generated from the search.
- `impressions`: Total number of times the search query appeared in search results.
- `ctr` (Click-Through Rate): The percentage of clicks relative to impressions.
- `average_position`: The average position of the query in search results.

## Scripts Overview
- `script_1.py`: Analyzes data preview (first few rows).
- `script_2.py`: Analyzes basic statistics (mean, median, etc.).
- `script_3.py`: Identifies top-performing keywords based on CTR.
- `script_4.py`: Analyzes keyword ranking performance.
- `script_5.py`: Visualizes search trends using basic plotting.

## How It Works
Each script reads the CSV file, performs specific analysis, and outputs the results. The analysis can be customized based on your needs.

## Getting Started
1. Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or later).
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib
   ```
3. Run any of the Python scripts to see the analysis results:
   ```bash
   python script_1.py
   ```

## Advanced Usage
- Modify the CSV file to include more rows or new columns.
- Customize the scripts to perform more complex analysis.
